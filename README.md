## Overview
A project focused on modeling relational databases through entity-relationship diagrams in MySQL. Each exercise tackles a real-life scenario—from eyewear sales to pizza orders, and even a mini YouTube system—reinforcing best practices in data organization, normalization, and query-friendly design.

## Technologies Used
* MySQL
* DBeaver / phpMyAdmin / any preferred DB tool
* Git
* ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) modeling tools

---

## Structure Levels

| Level | Exercise | Description |
| :---- | :------- | :---------- |
| 1     | 1        | Optician management: suppliers, products, clients, and employee sales tracking. |
| 2     | Pizza delivery system: orders, stores, clients, products, employees, and locality-province relationships. |
| 2     | 1        | YouTube-style platform: users, videos, channels, reactions, playlists, tags, and comments. |
